	<h1>I like to swimming in the summer</h1>
	<br> Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining 
	<br> and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool.
    <br> It's not an impressive pool, only three feet, but it's mine</p>

    <p>There are three reason i like to swimming</p>
    <li>I get lots of exercire</li>
    <li>I enjoy the  freesom</li>
    <li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun</li>
